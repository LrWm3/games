effects I havent explored

will have sign offs lean more towards accumulative effects rather than flat damage, although both salutations and sign-offs will have a mix of both at uncommon and rare tiers

aside: maybe put CC action on cooldown? can CC once every 30m?

reducing CCs per turn to 1 but improving what they do
preventing any CC to thread action for the first X turns but providing some bonus or boost instead
leverage boosting damage
credibility affecting stuff
winning with no credibility loss granting boosts
flat defense boosting effects (may revisit when i have more experience balancing)
start thread with full leverage (but weaker reply all?)
reply all with no leverage loss (but weaker reply all)
effects that get stronger when multiple from the same department are present
boost first contact you CC permanently in a stronger way per thread
escalating costs wins but is 3x stronger than normal
bonus rep for every win remaining at the end of the thread
boosts for # of CC which are not yours
winning at full health boosts stats permanently
grants bonus BCC space
every 10 lost credibility has some kind of effect grants max credibility permanently without healing

sign-offs

commmon

"thanks," first contact you per thread gains +5 reply to permanently

"Regards team," each CC at the end of the thread permanently gains x0.1 global damage for each other CC from the same department in the thread
"Thank you,", when buying Group Training, you have a 50% chance of gaining a BCC for free
